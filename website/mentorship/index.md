## Why Join?

I bring over a decade of experience in Scala and software engineering, including mentoring engineers, managers, and
product folks. While I don’t have all the answers, I’ve worked with a wide range of tools and challenges, especially in
functional programming and distributed systems.

This program is about sharing knowledge, building connections, and helping Scala engineers succeed.
